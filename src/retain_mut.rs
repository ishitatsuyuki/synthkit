/// Workaround for `Vec::retain()` passing `&T` instead of
/// `&mut T`. See RFC #2160 and issue #25477 for discussion
/// of inclusion of this in `std` (looks like it won't be),
/// and issue #43244 tracking `Vec::drain_filter()`, which
/// is in nightly as a more general proposed replacement,
/// but currently has stabilization issues.
///
/// This function calls `f` on each element *e* of `v`, with
/// *e* passed as a mutable reference. If `f` returns
/// `true`, *e* is retained; otherwise it is dropped.
/// `v` is truncated to the size of the retained elements, which
/// appear in the original order.
///
/// # Examples:
///
/// ```
/// # use synthkit::retain_mut;
/// let mut v = vec![2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8];
/// let f = |x: &mut usize| {
///     let odd = *x & 1 == 1;
///     if odd {
///         *x *= 2;
///     }
///     odd
/// };
/// retain_mut(&mut v, f);
/// assert_eq!(&vec![6, 10, 14], &v);
/// ```
